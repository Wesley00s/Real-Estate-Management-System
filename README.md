# Real Estate Control System

### Design of a real estate control system in accordance with the following requirements:

• Real estate brokers the sale or rental of many properties. Therefore, you need to keep information about all the properties you have worked on, whether they are on offer or already sold or rented. Properties can be of different types, such as houses, apartments, commercial rooms, farms or land.

• The real estate agency negotiates with many property owners who wish to sell or rent them. The real estate agency considers the individual or legal entity that owns one or more properties to be the owner. An owner must own (or have owned at some point) at least one property, but can own many.

• A property can be sold or rented several times (at different times obviously). It is necessary to register each sale or lease brokered by the real estate agency. This information must include the data of the owner and the buyer/lessor, as well as the broker who intermediated the transaction. In the case of sale, the amount paid for the property, the fees and taxes paid, as well as the percentage received by the real estate agency must be included. In the case of leasing, the monthly rental amount, the duration of the rental, the guarantor's details or the amount of the deposit must be recorded.

• In the case of rentals, the real estate agency undertakes to pass on the rental value to the property owner, after deducting their percentage. Thus, whenever a landlord pays the rent (with possible interest in case of delay), the real estate agency will pass on to the owner the amount paid minus their commission. This way, all rent payments must be recorded.

• The company has many brokers working for it. It is the responsibility of brokers to serve real estate clients and mediate the sale or rental of properties. It is therefore necessary to register all brokers who work or have worked for the real estate agency.

• The real estate agency considers clients to be individuals or legal entities that buy or rent properties offered by the company, as well as owners of these properties. Therefore, it is necessary to keep records of the data of all real estate agency clients, current or previous.
